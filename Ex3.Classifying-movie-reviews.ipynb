        "The **IMDB** dataset is a set of 50.000 highly-polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They are split into 25.000 reviews for training and 25.000 reviews for testing, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.\n",
        "The IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras. It has already been preprocessed: the reviews (sequences of words)\n",
        "have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary.\n",

        "3. read the entire notebook carefully.\n",
        "    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding\n",
        "    * run the notebook for the first time and note the result in your markdown result table (your test plan).\n",
        "4. go into the section 'building the ANN'.\n",
        "    * add the missing code that does create a network as shown in the image in the lecture slides on page 166 (File: 'DIS21a.1-7.HANDS_ON.First.DLNetwork.Architectures.for.Solving.Three.Interesting.Problems.pdf')\n",

        "    * add those hyperparameters as columns in the table and note the accuracy you achieve\n",

        "11. until now there were 2 hidden layers. Try to use 1 or 3 hidden layers and see how it affects the test accuracy. Use again a little table. Describe your observations.\n",
        "12. Try to use layers with more hidden units or less hidden units: 32 units, 64 units, 128 units ...! What effect can you observe?\n",
